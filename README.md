# Hi, I'm Ritik Sarang! 👋

I recently conducted an analysis of weather data using SQL to gain insights into various weather parameters and their impact. This analysis was motivated by a desire to understand how weather conditions influence different aspects of life, industries, and decision-making processes.

## 💡 Weather Data Importance:

Weather data plays a crucial role in numerous domains, ranging from agriculture and transportation to tourism and public health. Understanding weather patterns and trends can help businesses, policymakers, and individuals make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and optimize operations.

## 🎯 Specific Analysis Goals:

The primary goals of my analysis were to:

Identify temperature trends over time.
Analyze air quality patterns and pollutant levels.
Explore the relationship between weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and visibility.

## 🚀 Use Cases:
The insights gained from weather data analysis have various practical applications:

- Agriculture: Optimizing planting and harvesting schedules based on weather forecasts.
- Transportation: Planning routes and schedules to minimize disruptions caused by adverse weather conditions.
- Energy Management: Adjusting energy consumption and production strategies in response to weather patterns.
- Public Health: Monitoring air quality and weather-related health risks to protect vulnerable populations.

## 📊 Data Sources:
The weather data used in this analysis was sourced from reputable sources such as kaggle. Dataset involves historical weather records and real-time observations for analysis.
