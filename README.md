# Indian-Weather-Analysis-with-SQL
This GitHub project contains SQL queries for analyzing weather data. The provided SQL queries can be used to extract insights and perform analysis on various weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, air quality, precipitation, and visibility.


Examples:

Temperature Analysis:
Analyze temperature trends over time.
Identify locations with the highest temperature deviations.
Wind Analysis:
Analyze wind speed distribution across different locations.
Identify locations prone to high wind speeds.
Air Quality Analysis:
Analyze air quality indices and pollutant levels.
Identify locations with poor air quality conditions.
Precipitation Analysis:
Analyze precipitation patterns and intensity.
Identify locations with high precipitation rates.
Visibility Analysis:
Analyze visibility conditions across different locations.
Identify locations with poor visibility due to weather conditions.
